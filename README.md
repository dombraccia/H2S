# The capacity to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) via cysteine degradation is ubiquitous in the human gut microbiome

This is the code repository for the manuscript "The capacity to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) via cysteine degradation is ubiquitous in the human gut microbiome" available at [Frontiers]().

In this projcet, we searched [thousands of bacterial reference genomes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0603-3) for genes capable of hydrogen suflide (H2S) production via cysteine degradation. This required creating a custom, multifacted computational workflow which we have visualized here:

We found that cysteine degrading genes are ubiquitous in the human gut microbiome and may contribute significantly to overall H2S production in the healthy, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) gut.
