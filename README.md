# The capacity to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) via cysteine degradation is ubiquitous in the human gut microbiome

In this projcet, we searched [thousands of bacterial reference genomes]() for genes capable of hydrogen suflide (H2S) production via cysteine degradation. We found that cysteine degrading genes are ubiquitous in the human gut microbiome and may contribute significantly to overall H2S production in the healthy, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) gut.
